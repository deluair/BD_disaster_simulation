# Bangladesh Disaster Simulation

A comprehensive simulation framework for modeling and analyzing disaster risks, impacts, and management strategies in Bangladesh.

## Overview

The Bangladesh Disaster Simulation is a sophisticated modeling system that simulates the complex interactions between natural hazards, vulnerability, exposure, resilience, and emergency response in Bangladesh. It provides insights for disaster risk reduction, climate change adaptation, and emergency management planning.

## Features

- **Multi-Hazard Modeling**: Simulates various hazards including floods, cyclones, river erosion, landslides, and droughts
- **Climate Change Integration**: Models future climate scenarios (RCP4.5, RCP8.5) and their impacts on disaster frequency and intensity
- **Comprehensive Risk Framework**: Incorporates exposure, vulnerability, resilience, governance, and socioeconomic factors
- **Emergency Response Simulation**: Models response operations, resource allocation, and effectiveness
- **Advanced Reporting**: Generates HTML and JSON reports with visualizations and metrics
- **Temporal Analysis**: Projects disaster risk over time (2025-2050) under different scenarios
- **Technology Adoption Modeling**: Evaluates the impact of technology on disaster risk reduction

## Key Simulation Components

- **Hazard Models**: Simulate physical hazard events based on historical data and climate projections
- **Exposure Model**: Represents population, buildings, infrastructure, and economic activities
- **Vulnerability Model**: Calculates expected damages based on hazard-specific vulnerability functions
- **Early Warning Model**: Simulates warning systems and their effectiveness
- **Emergency Response Model**: Models disaster response operations and resource allocation
- **Recovery Model**: Projects post-disaster recovery trajectories
- **Climate Change Model**: Integrates climate scenarios to modify hazard patterns
- **Transboundary Model**: Accounts for cross-border influences and effects
- **Governance Model**: Represents institutional capacity and policy frameworks
- **Socioeconomic Model**: Models differential impacts across social groups
- **Technology Model**: Evaluates adoption of technologies for disaster management

## Running the Simulation

To run the main simulation:

```bash
python bangladesh_disaster_simulation.py
```

To generate reports from simulation results:

```bash
python generate_report.py --input simulation_results/simulation_results_TIMESTAMP.json --output reports --format html
```

To generate a sample report for demonstration:

```bash
python generate_report.py --sample --output reports --format html
```

## Report Generation

The framework generates detailed reports to communicate simulation results:

- **HTML Reports**: Interactive visualizations with charts and metrics
- **JSON Reports**: Structured data for further analysis
- **CSV Reports**: Tabular data for statistical analysis

Reports include key metrics such as:
- Average annual losses
- Casualties and displaced populations
- Vulnerability and resilience indicators
- Adaptation investments and costs
- Scenario comparisons (baseline vs. climate change scenarios)

## Requirements

The simulation framework uses several Python libraries:
- NumPy for numerical calculations
- JSON for data handling
- Pathlib for file operations
- Logging for execution logs
- Datetime for timestamp operations

## Development

The framework is designed to be modular and extensible, allowing for:
- Integration of new hazard types
- Customization of vulnerability functions
- Addition of region-specific parameters
- Enhancement of visualization capabilities
- Integration with external data sources
